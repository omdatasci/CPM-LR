Chemical property modelling using Logistic Regression model.

Developed a model to predict accurate properties for cement mixtures and compositions, through which the company can accelerate its production pipeline and R&D processes and effectively save a lot of resources.

Project Steps:-
1) Collected and preprocessed data on the chemical and physical properties of raw materials used in cement production and the resulting properties of the finished products.
2) Identified the most relevant features and worked on it with different techniques(Handling null values, Correlation, Varience) to improve the predictive power of the model.
3) Developed and trained predictive models using various machine learning techniques such as Multilinear regression, Plynomial Regression, Lasso Regression etc.
4) Evaluated and selected the best-performing model(In this case Polynomial Regression model gave us the best accuracy) based on accuracy, robustness, and generalizability.
5) build a web app of that model using flask framework and deploy the model into production environment with the help of ngrok host platform.

Outcome - Model is accurately predicting the cement property (compressive strength in this case).
